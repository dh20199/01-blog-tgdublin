                    <p>Dear Prof. Price,</p>
                </div>

                <div class="text">
                        <p>I was told to enrol in this class by someone, I don't know who. It seems like kind of a bad idea but I'm going to do it anyway because I don't have any ideas of my own and anyway I always do what I'm told. I have a couple of questions though, can you please answer them? </p>

                        <h1>Assignments</h1>
                        
                        <p>Are the assignments actually required, or can I just say I did them?  In particular I am concerned about the following:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                           <li>- Assignment 1</li>
                            <li>- Assignment 2</li>
                            <li>- All the rest of the assignments</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h1>Lectures</h1>
                        
                        <p>Is there any point in coming to class? I looked you up on Rate My Little Pony (https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/840273242953005718/), and your ratings are pretty terrible.</p>
                        
                        <h1>Course Website</h1>
                        
                        <p>I have taken a look at the course website. It sure seems pretty weird.  Do you mind if I just ignore this part?</p>
                        
                        <p>I look forward to a fruitful semester.</p>
