        <p>There have been many technological revolutions which have come before and after the industrialization 
        of Europe. Most wouldnâ€™t contest that we currently are going through an immense technological revolution,
        centered around the increased capacity to communicate and educate, as well as the general improvements to quality
        of life through applications and devices which were mere fantasy before the internet, let alone the computer. 
        Yet these great changes to our society are nothing new, and for that very reason, looking back at the revolutions 
        of the past, specifically the one which ushered in the modern era, may act as a useful guide to ensure those changes 
        are for the good of society.</p>
        <p>One thing to consider is how the industrial revolution spread in the past. 
        For many decades, the British who had virtually monopolized the production of processed and factory produced 
        goods, had made every attempt to keep industrial technology within the confines of their island. 
        They were reluctant to even industrialize their colonies for fear of them gaining enough power to become independent. 
        But as we know today, these attempts all failed in the end. There seems to be an inverse of this situation occurring 
        in our modern day, with what was formerly an open internet connecting people from across the world, 
        nations are attempting to further regulate whatever parts of the internet they can. 
        In China internet usage is quite limited, and in the EU,  there is a concerted effort to regulate 
        what content can be distributed freely.</p>
        <p><strong> Is there a similar futility to this effort as there was for 
        the British in the early 19th century? Or perhaps there is a need to tame the wild west of the web.</strong></p>
